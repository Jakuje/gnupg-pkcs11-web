<p>gnupg-pkcs11 is a project to implement a BSD-licensed standard smart-card support in <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">GnuPG</a>.</p>
<p>We all disagree with Werner Koch's attitude towards PKCS#11 which is the de-facto standard to work with cryptographic tokens.</p>
<p>In short, we support gnupg-pkcs11-scd daemon as a drop-in replacement for the scd shipped with GnuPG.</p>
